1. **Include the Stylesheet:**

   Link the CSS stylesheet in the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/styles.css">
   ```

2. **HTML Structure:**

   Create the HTML structure for each card in your HTML file. You can customize the content within each card as needed:

   ```html
   <ul class="cards-container">
       <li class="card sedans-card">
           <!-- Card content here -->

   ```

3. **Customize Styles:**

   Customize the card styles by modifying the CSS variables and classes in the `styles.css` file. You can change colors, fonts, and other visual elements to match your website's design.

4. **Responsive Design:**

   The component is designed to be responsive, but you can further adjust its appearance for different screen sizes by adding CSS rules in the respective media queries (e.g., small screens, medium screens, large screens, etc.) in the `styles.css` file.
